    <h2>
        Beans on toast have been eaten for years everyday in the UK for breakfast, lunch and dinner. It’s a super simple dish, but it’s comfort food on a plate for many of us. I hope you’ll enjoy it, too!
    </h2>
    <p>
        If you’re from Britain, you’re probably wondering why on earth there’s even a need for a “recipe” for beans on toast, am I right?
    </p>
    <p>
        However, if you see what is out there on Google when you search “beans on toast”, you too will be horrified! Recipes from people who I’m guessing have never even stepped foot in the UK. And so much misinformation about what it is, that the steam was coming out of my ears! I felt like I had to write about beans on toast asap! So here were are.

    <h2>
        Ingredients
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 can Heinz baked beans</li>
        <li>Your favourite bread</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Recipe</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Put the Heinz beans into a small pot over medium low heat.
            </li>
            <li>Put the bread in the toaster, and make the toast as desired. (If you like, you can butter the toast, but I find it unecessary as the beans are the primary flavor.)
            </li>
            <li>Stir the beans, and heat until almost boiling, but don’t allow to boil. (According to directions on the tin, this will affect the flavor.)
            </li>
            <li>Place the toast on plates, and spoon ⅓ tin of the beans over the top of each slice.
            </li>
            <li>Serve immediately.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Enjoy; you’re now closer to being an honorary Brit! 🇬🇧 This has to be the easiest “recipe” ever, right?
